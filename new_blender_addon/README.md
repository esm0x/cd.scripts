Our programmer makes custom Blender addons that need to be distributed to all users. This script was made and put on every user's desktop and automatically loads new/updatd addons to Blender after double-clicking.
* Initially all addons are put on our network-shared drive by the programmer
* The script copies all files from that specific directory and puts them in the Blender directory
* Simple but works every time - note that Blende rversion needs to be the same for all users
